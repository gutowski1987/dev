            // now here is the problem!

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
            const team2 = players.slice();

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in

            // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

            // and think we make a copy:
            //const captain = person;
            //captain.age = 70;

            // how do we take a copy instead?
